# Bubble General Development Process

1. All development is done on Main development branch

3. Once staging request is approved, _Dev Lead_ creates a Save Point in bubble and adds it to the [**Save Points table**](https://www.notion.so/1e913710276147f09aceb4a8267fe5ee?pvs=21)
4. _Dev Lead_ pushes changes to a staging branch for _Business_ review
