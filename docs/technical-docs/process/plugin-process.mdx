# Plugin Development Process

1. All development is done on cloned <Highlight>development plugin</Highlight> assigned to the _Developer_ and attached to a bubble sandbox branch
2. _Developer_ notifies _Dev Lead_ that a function is ready to review
3. _Dev Lead_ tests and confirms working function and approves code
4. _Dev Lead_ migrates function from <Highlight>development plugin</Highlight> to <Highlight>Main Plugin</Highlight> and creates a new plugin production release
5. _Team_ and _Business_ tests function on a staging branch and approves functionality
6. _Dev Lead_ updates <Highlight>development environment</Highlight> to use most recent version of the plugin and pushes to <Highlight>Production</Highlight>
7. _Dev Lead_ pushes to Sub Apps
